# **PROJECT GIT & GITHUB**

# **Dictionary**

* <u>Github</u> is a backup of my timeline ! 

* <u>Git</u> is my magic timeline, each timeline is refering to one project

* Git can track files in sub-folders, there it is not needed

* Initializing it will create a git repository (timeline) inside of another Git repository

# **Starting my timeline**

with *$ git init*, you initiate an *empty timeline*

git **add** new_file.txt adds a file to a timeline

**4 conceptual areas** 

* <u>Developing area</u> : folder (First_Git_project)

* <u>Local repository</u> : timeline of *The Godfather* subfolder

* <u>Staging area</u> : place we put to organize things BEFORE they go to our timeline

* ??? 



# **Saving a point in time**

We should commit information and be descriptive about the changes (why it was changed, how this addresses the issue, what are the effects and limitations of this change)

* In the staging area we organize our files before commiting.
  
  From *developing area*, we **<mark>ADD</mark>** files to the *staging area*, then from there we **<mark>COMMIT</mark>** to the *local repository*.  



==> It's very helpful to keep track of your changes, especially when you are working on several projects, you will easily forget them !



* What if I don't use -m "nice message" ?
  
  --> You get an error ! 



# **COMMANDS**

* git init

* git add

* git commit -m "Meaning full message to explain the changes (why, how, effect(s), limitation(s)"

* git status



# Where is my content ?

To check what is where, we can check the git status : tool that will give you all this information

*git status* : command to check the status of your project

**! you should alway check before commiting !**
