github is yet another versioning system which I probably will not be able to learn.
Git: is my magic timelne, each timeline is refering to one project
GitHub: The backup of my timelines
Inside my computer is the local versions of my documents.
Developing area is my repository
local repository is the timeline in the folder
local repository keeping history 
of all changes
consepts
	Dev area
	Staging area 
	local repository
commands
	git init
	git add
	git commit -m "meaningful message"
	git status

always add -m before your message
what if I don't use - befor message
git status is very important

git log provides you information about the history
git diff ID1..ID2 shows changes between two commits with ids ID1 and ID2
these IDs you can get with the git log command

git show <ID1>..<ID2>shows morst resent commits
git diff <ID1>..<ID2>the same
